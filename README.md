This project introduces an innovative rental management system tailored for office building owners, leveraging facial recognition technology within the Internet of Things (IoT) framework. The system streamlines property rental processes, automates customer information management, validates lease periods, sends renewal notifications, and offers secure access control through facial recognition and remote door opening capabilities. It is designed to reduce administrative burden and enhance the management efficiency of properties and contracts.

## Technical Points
The system is the backend component of an Internet of Things (IoT) project, with IoT devices purchased from a specific brand and model. It communicates with the devices via the MQTT protocol and provides RESTful APIs based on the Flask framework for use by the management backend.

## Highlights
The system employs a Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow, ensuring thorough communication with the property owners to anticipate various potential unexpected situations. Extensive targeted automated validations have been conducted to ensure that the system does not impact the customer's user experience in real-world applications.
